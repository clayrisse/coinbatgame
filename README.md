# **Mortal Coinbat**

## **Description**



Tired of fighting with someone to decide little things like who picks the movie or whose turn is it to take out the trash? Challenge them to a "Mortal Coinbat" and determine who gets to fuck off ;`)`

Who ever wins 3 times in a row will taste a "flawless victory"! 

Loser gets a pretty nice fuck off message from the winner.



Mortal Coinbat was developed using JavaScript as part of the Ironhack developer bootcamp (WebDev-FT-062020) using the "Fuck Off As A Service" API.

**Message page:** A customizable "Fuck off" message to the losser from the API
